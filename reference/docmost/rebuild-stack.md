With just one experienced programmer working on this, leveraging LLMs and AI-assisted coding editors, the timeline and approach shift significantly due to the lack of parallel task execution. I’ll adjust the estimates and recommendations accordingly, then address building from scratch for performance, how Notion is built, and open-source Notion alternatives. Let’s dive in.

### Estimating Development with One Programmer and AI Assistance

#### Assumptions
- **Programmer**: One experienced full-stack developer (proficient in web, desktop, mobile dev).
- **AI Tools**: LLMs (e.g., Grok, GitHub Copilot) and AI editors (e.g., VS Code with AI plugins) for code generation, debugging, and optimization (~20-30% efficiency boost).
- **Scope**: 
  - Desktop app (Mac/Windows) using Electron.
  - Mobile app (iPhone/Android) using Capacitor/Ionic.
  - Reusing your customized Docmost web app (with OIDC SSO and additional features).
  - Basic features: Document editing, real-time collaboration, OIDC auth, partial offline support.
- **Work Hours**: 40 hours/week (full-time solo effort).
- **Experience**: Comfortable with Ruby/Rails, JavaScript, and native build tools (Xcode, Android Studio).

#### Development Breakdown
1. **Desktop App (Electron)**:
   - **Setup**: 1 week (40 hours) — Electron config, integrate Docmost web app.
   - **Core Features**: 2-3 weeks (80-120 hours) — UI shell, auth, doc editing.
   - **Native Enhancements**: 1-2 weeks (40-80 hours) — menus, notifications, file access.
   - **Optimization**: 1 week (40 hours) — code splitting, caching.
   - **Total Without AI**: 5-7 weeks (200-280 hours).
   - **With AI**: 4-5 weeks (160-200 hours) — AI accelerates boilerplate (e.g., Electron config) and suggests optimizations.

2. **Mobile App (Capacitor)**:
   - **Setup**: 1 week (40 hours) — Capacitor init, iOS/Android setup.
   - **Core Features**: 3-4 weeks (120-160 hours) — WebView, auth, doc editing.
   - **Native Features**: 2-3 weeks (80-120 hours) — camera, notifications, mobile UI tweaks.
   - **Optimization**: 1-2 weeks (40-80 hours) — responsive design, offline caching.
   - **Total Without AI**: 7-10 weeks (280-400 hours).
   - **With AI**: 5-7 weeks (200-280 hours) — AI helps with mobile-specific code and debugging.

3. **Testing & Polish**:
   - QA, bug fixes, UI refinement across platforms: 2-3 weeks (80-120 hours).
   - **With AI**: 1.5-2 weeks (60-80 hours) — AI generates tests and flags issues faster.

#### Total Estimate
- **Without AI**: 14-20 weeks (560-800 hours).
- **With AI**: 10.5-14 weeks (420-560 hours), assuming 20-30% efficiency gain.
- **Timeline**: 
  - **Best Case**: ~2.5-3 months (10.5-12 weeks) if everything goes smoothly and AI is heavily utilized.
  - **Realistic Case**: ~3-3.5 months (12-14 weeks), accounting for learning curves or unexpected issues.
- **Cost**: 
  - Assuming $50-$100/hour (freelance rate):
    - Low end: $21,000-$28,000 (420-560 hours at $50).
    - High end: $42,000-$56,000 (420-560 hours at $100).
  - If it’s your own time, this is just effort, not monetary cost.

#### Factors Affecting Estimate
- **Feature Creep**: Adding complex features (e.g., full offline sync) could add 2-4 weeks.
- **AI Dependence**: If you’re skilled at prompting LLMs, you might hit the lower end (10.5 weeks); less experience could push it to 14 weeks.
- **Debugging**: Solo work means no second pair of eyes, so tricky bugs (e.g., Capacitor quirks) might slow you down.

#### Strategy for Solo Work
- **Prioritize Desktop First**: Electron is quicker to set up and test (4-5 weeks), giving you a functional app sooner.
- **Mobile Second**: Tackle Capacitor after (5-7 weeks), reusing lessons from desktop.
- **Iterate**: Build minimum viable versions, then enhance (e.g., add offline later).
- **AI Leverage**: Use LLMs for boilerplate (e.g., Electron `main.js`, Capacitor plugins), UI snippets, and debugging (e.g., “fix this WebView crash”).

### Building from Scratch for Performance Optimization

If you scrap the Docmost base and rebuild from scratch with performance as the goal (e.g., faster startup, lower memory use, better scalability), here’s how to approach it as a solo programmer, using Docmost/Notion as inspiration.

#### Tech Stack
1. **Backend**:
   - **Language**: Rust (high performance, memory safety).
     - Why: Rust outperforms Ruby/Rails in speed and resource use (e.g., AppFlowy uses it).
   - **Framework**: Axum (lightweight, async web server).
   - **Database**: SQLite (local-first) + PostgreSQL (cloud sync).
     - Why: SQLite enables offline mode; Postgres scales for multi-user.
   - **Real-Time**: Yjs (CRDT library) over WebSockets for collaboration.
     - Why: Lightweight, supports offline sync.

2. **Frontend (Web)**:
   - **Framework**: SvelteKit (compiles to vanilla JS, faster than React).
     - Why: Minimal runtime overhead vs. React (Notion’s choice).
   - **State**: Jotai (lightweight, atomic state management).
   - **Performance**: WebAssembly (Rust) for rich text editing.

3. **Desktop App**:
   - **Framework**: Tauri (Rust + WebView).
     - Why: ~5-10 MB binaries vs. Electron’s 100+ MB, native speed.

4. **Mobile App**:
   - **Framework**: Flutter (Dart).
     - Why: Native performance, single codebase for iOS/Android, better than Capacitor for speed.

5. **Architecture**:
   - **Local-First**: Store docs in SQLite locally, sync with cloud via Rust backend.
   - **API**: REST + WebSockets for real-time updates.

#### Effort Estimate (Solo, From Scratch)
- **Backend**: 8-12 weeks (Rust learning curve, API, collab logic).
- **Web Frontend**: 6-8 weeks (SvelteKit UI, doc editing).
- **Desktop (Tauri)**: 4-6 weeks (integrate web frontend, native shell).
- **Mobile (Flutter)**: 8-10 weeks (rewrite UI, native features).
- **Testing/Polish**: 4-6 weeks.
- **Total Without AI**: 30-42 weeks (1200-1680 hours).
- **With AI**: 24-33 weeks (960-1320 hours) — AI speeds up Rust/Flutter boilerplate and UI design.
- **Timeline**: 6-8 months, assuming full-time effort.

#### Why Notion/Docmost Weaknesses Prompt a Rebuild
- **Docmost**: Ruby/Rails is slow for large-scale apps; web-wrapped apps (Electron/Capacitor) are heavy.
- **Notion**: React + Electron bloat, no offline mode, server-dependent.

#### Trade-Offs
- **Pros**: Superior performance (e.g., <1s startup, <50 MB memory), offline support.
- **Cons**: Massive effort for one person, even with AI. Docmost reuse is 3x faster.

### How Notion Is Built
- **Backend**: Node.js (TypeScript inferred from job postings), likely with PostgreSQL or a NoSQL DB (e.g., DynamoDB) for scalability.
- **Frontend**: React (visible in `notion.so` source), bundled with Webpack, using libraries like Lodash and Slate (rich text).
- **Desktop**: Electron (confirmed by `.exe`/`.dmg` behavior).
- **Mobile**: React Native or WebView (UI resembles web app, less native polish).
- **Collaboration**: Operational Transform or CRDTs over WebSockets (speculated from real-time behavior).
- **Performance**: 
  - Slow startup (5-10s on large workspaces) due to React hydration and Electron overhead.
  - No offline mode—fully server-dependent.

### Open-Source Notion Alternatives
Yes, there are open-source alternatives you could use as a base instead of Docmost or a full rebuild:
1. **AppFlowy** (https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy):
   - **Stack**: Rust (backend), Flutter (frontend), SQLite (local storage).
   - **Features**: Docs, boards, offline mode, real-time collab via Yjs.
   - **License**: AGPL-3.0.
   - **Fit**: High performance, native apps (Mac/Windows/Linux/iOS/Android). Add OIDC SSO via Rust (e.g., `oauth2` crate).
   - **Effort**: 4-6 weeks to customize vs. 24-33 weeks from scratch.

2. **Focalboard** (https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard):
   - **Stack**: Go (backend), React (frontend), Electron (desktop).
   - **Features**: Kanban boards, basic docs.
   - **License**: MIT (more permissive than AGPL).
   - **Fit**: Lighter than Docmost, but less doc-focused. Add OIDC and mobile support (Capacitor).

3. **Anytype** (https://github.com/anytypeio):
   - **Stack**: Go (backend), TypeScript/React (frontend), local-first.
   - **Features**: Docs, databases, offline sync.
   - **License**: AGPL-3.0.
   - **Fit**: Robust, but complex to extend.

#### Recommendation
- **AppFlowy**: Best match for performance and native apps. Customize it with OIDC SSO and your features in ~1-1.5 months vs. 6-8 months from scratch.

### Final Recommendation for Solo Programmer
- **Reuse Docmost**: Build Electron (4-5 weeks) and Capacitor (5-7 weeks) apps in 10.5-14 weeks (2.5-3.5 months). Fastest path to working apps.
- **Alternative**: Fork AppFlowy, add OIDC and your features in 4-6 weeks (1-1.5 months), leveraging its performance and native apps.
- **From Scratch**: Only if you’re committed to 6-8 months and need top-tier performance/offline support. Use Rust/Tauri/Flutter.
