# Pitch
Your strategy to focus on services first to attract creators and then leverage that user base for an investor-type campaign is spot-on. It’s a two-step play: build traction with US TikTok/IG creators via service rewards ($50-$500), then pitch to bigger investors with proof of an engaged user base. I’ll flesh that out and answer your other question about GoFundMe vs. alternatives vs. building your own open-source version, including examples.

### Services-First Strategy + Investor Follow-Up
#### Step 1: Services Campaign (2 Weeks)
- **Goal**: Raise $5K-$10K from 50-100 US creators/backers at $50-$500, offering service rewards.
- **Why**: Hooks your target users (US TikTok/IG creators), proves demand, and costs you nothing in cash—just platform access.
- **Tiers**:
  - **$50**: 5 VVP + 1 $10 sponsor slot.
  - **$250**: 25 VVP + 3 $10 slots + “Early Adopter” badge.
  - **$500**: 50 VVP + 5 $10 slots + priority listing.
- **Execution**: GoFundMe + DMs to creators (24-36 hours, as planned).
- **Outcome**: 1,000+ users if 1-2% of DM’d creators join, $5K-$10K raised.

#### Step 2: Investor Campaign (1-2 Months Later)
- **Goal**: Raise $25K-$100K from 5-20 US angels/investors at $1K-$10K, offering income slots or equity (post-US LLC).
- **Why**: 1,000+ invested users is a killer stat—shows traction, virality, and revenue potential (e.g., $10 slots trading at $50+).
- **Pitch**: “ViralPulse has 1,000 US creators using sponsor slots. $5K gets you 5 tradable slots—$200+ profit potential—or equity in our US entity.”
- **Tiers** (Post-LLC Example):
  - **$1,000**: 2 tradable slots + 50 VVP.
  - **$5,000**: 5 tradable slots + 100 VVP + 0.5% equity.
  - **$10,000**: 10 tradable slots + 200 VVP + 1% equity.
- **Execution**: AngelList, LinkedIn, or SeedInvest (US platforms) with a polished demo + user data.
- **Outcome**: Funds US LLC, marketing, and Phase 2 (e.g., tap-to-connect).

#### Why It Works
- **Step 1**: Creators invest small amounts ($50-$500) for tools they’ll use—low barrier, high adoption.
- **Step 2**: Investors see a live user base (e.g., 1,000 creators, $5K in slots traded)—de-risks their $1K-$10K bet.
- **US Focus**: TikTok/IG’s 70M+ US users = massive market; early traction hooks US angels.

### GoFundMe vs. Alternatives vs. Open-Source Version
You asked whether to use GoFundMe, another platform, or build your own using an open-source GoFundMe-like software. Here’s the breakdown, with examples:

#### 1. GoFundMe
- **Pros**:
  - **Speed**: Set up in 1 hour—perfect for your 2-week timeline.
  - **US Reach**: Huge US audience (70%+ of users), ideal for TikTok/IG creators.
  - **No Entity**: Works with your personal PayPal—no LLC needed.
  - **Payments**: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction, direct to PayPal or a US friend’s bank.
- **Cons**:
  - **Exposure**: Limited—relies on your marketing (Twitter/X, TikTok DMs).
  - **Fees**: $30-$150 on $1K-$5K—small but adds up.
  - **Investor Fit**: Donation vibe, not equity—less appealing to angels.
- **Best For**: Your services campaign—$5K-$10K from 50-100 creators/backers in 2 weeks.

#### 2. Other Platforms
- **Kickstarter**:
  - **Pros**: US-heavy, rewards-based, built-in audience (41% success rate).
  - **Cons**: All-or-nothing funding, 5% fee + 3-5% processing, needs bank account (harder without entity).
  - **Payments**: Stripe to a US account—tricky personally.
  - **Fit**: Good for creators, but 2 weeks is tight to prep a campaign video + rewards.
- **Indiegogo**:
  - **Pros**: Flexible funding (keep what you raise), US-focused, tech-friendly.
  - **Cons**: 5% fee + 3% processing, needs bank account, less traction than GoFundMe.
  - **Payments**: Similar to Kickstarter—needs entity or workaround.
  - **Fit**: Viable alternative to GoFundMe, but less US creator pull.
- **Patreon**:
  - **Pros**: Creator-centric, recurring pledges possible.
  - **Cons**: Subscription model, not one-time raise—5-12% fees.
  - **Fit**: Wrong vibe—ongoing support, not a launch raise.
- **Best Alternative**: Indiegogo—flexible, US-friendly, but GoFundMe wins on speed/simplicity.

#### 3. Open-Source Crowdfunding (Build Your Own)
- **Examples**:
  - **Selfstarter**: Ruby-based, simple donation page (GitHub: foretcode/selfstarter).
  - **Crowdtilt Open**: Rails app with payment integration (GitHub: crowdtilt/crowdtilt-open).
  - **OpenFunding**: PHP-based, lightweight (GitHub: openfunding/openfunding).
- **Pros**:
  - **Control**: Customize tiers (e.g., VVP + slots), no platform fees.
  - **Payments**: Stripe (2.9% + $0.30) direct to your PayPal—entity optional.
  - **Branding**: `viralpulse.com/fund` feels pro.
- **Cons**:
  - **Time**: 10-20 hours to set up (even with AI)—prompt Cursor: “Install Selfstarter in Rust with Stripe,” then tweak.
  - **Exposure**: Zero—100% reliant on your marketing (Twitter/X, DMs).
  - **Hosting**: $5-$10/month on DigitalOcean + domain ($10/year).
- **Best For**: Long-term if you want a custom hub—overkill for 2 weeks.

#### Comparison
| **Option**       | **Setup Time** | **US Exposure** | **Fees**         | **Payments**         | **Fit for 2 Weeks** |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| GoFundMe         | 1 hour         | Moderate (your push) | 2.9% + $0.30    | PayPal, no entity    | High                |
| Indiegogo        | 2-3 days       | Moderate         | 5% + 3%          | Bank, entity tricky  | Medium              |
| Selfstarter (OS) | 10-20 hours    | None (you market) | Stripe only (2.9%) | PayPal, custom       | Low                 |

#### Recommendation
- **GoFundMe**: Wins for your 2-week services campaign—fastest setup, US creator-friendly, no entity hassle. Raise $5K-$10K with tiers ($50-$500), market via Twitter/X + TikTok DMs.
- **Why Not Others**: Indiegogo’s slower, open-source eats your 36-hour MVP window (10-20 hours is 30-50% of your time).
- **Future**: Build an open-source version (e.g., Selfstarter in Rust) post-raise for investor round—showcases your tech chops + saves fees.

### GoFundMe Draft (Services Campaign)
**Title**: “ViralPulse: Monetize TikTok Virality—Back the US Creator Revolution!”
**Goal**: $10,000
**Story**:
- “I’m a 30-year dev launching ViralPulse—a tool for US TikTok/IG creators to earn from viral posts. Sponsor slots start at $10, trade up as posts blow up. With AI, I’ll ship the MVP in 2 weeks. Join me—$50 gets you in!”
- **Why**: “70M+ US creators need better monetization—ViralPulse is it.”
- **Funds**: “$5K-$10K covers hosting, fees, and my time to launch.”
**Rewards**:
- **$50**: 5 VVP + 1 $10 slot—“Start earning now!”
- **$250**: 25 VVP + 3 $10 slots + “Early Adopter” badge.

### My Take
- **Services First**: Perfect—$5K-$10K from creators in 2 weeks via GoFundMe builds your US user base (1,000+ potential). Then pitch investors with “1K creators onboard—$5K buys tradable slots!”
- **GoFundMe**: Best for now—quick, US-ready, no dev overhead. Open-source is a later play.
- **Next**: Use $5K+ to form a US LLC, then hit angels with income slots.
