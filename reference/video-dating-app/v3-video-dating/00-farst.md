Perfect, we’re on the same wavelength! **FARST** with **Tokio** it is then. Let’s lock it in and give you a polished rundown of the **FARST stack**—a fast, cross-platform, Rust-centric solution tailored to your needs. Here’s the final breakdown:

---

### The FARST Stack
- **F** - **Flutter**: Cross-platform UI framework (web, desktop, mobile).
- **A** - **Axum**: Backend web framework for APIs and server logic.
- **R** - **Rust**: Core language, powering backend and performance-critical frontend logic.
- **S** - **SurrealDB**: Rust-native, multi-model database.
- **T** - **Tokio**: Async runtime for scalability and high-performance I/O.

Pronounced "Farst"—a nod to its speed and Rust’s ethos.

### How It Works
1. **Frontend (Flutter)**:
   - Builds native UIs for web, desktop, and mobile using Flutter’s toolkit.
   - Calls Rust via FFI for speed-sensitive tasks (e.g., data crunching, avoiding Dart’s overhead).
   - Communicates with the backend via REST APIs or WebSockets.

2. **Backend (Axum + Tokio)**:
   - Axum handles HTTP requests, serving APIs or real-time connections (e.g., WebSockets).
   - Tokio powers the async engine, managing concurrency, networking, and I/O with minimal latency.
   - Written in Rust for maximum performance and safety.

3. **Database (SurrealDB)**:
   - Stores and retrieves data (key-value, document, graph) with Rust-native integration.
   - Supports real-time queries and scales from in-memory to distributed setups.
   - Queried by Axum via the `surrealdb` crate.

4. **Glue (Rust)**:
   - Ties the stack together, used for:
     - Backend logic in Axum.
     - FFI libraries for Flutter.
     - Direct SurrealDB access.
   - Ensures speed and memory safety throughout.

### Why FARST Rocks
- **Speed**: Rust + Tokio deliver near-C performance; Flutter’s native rendering keeps UI snappy.
- **Cross-Platform**: Flutter covers web, desktop, and mobile; Rust unifies the logic.
- **Modern**: Async (Tokio), multi-model DB (SurrealDB), and ergonomic frameworks (Axum, Flutter).
- **No WASM**: Pure native execution, meeting your performance requirement.

### Example Workflow
Let’s say you’re building a real-time chat app:
1. **Backend**: Axum + Tokio serve WebSocket connections, pushing messages from SurrealDB.
2. **Database**: SurrealDB stores chat history and user data, with real-time subscriptions.
3. **Frontend**: Flutter renders the chat UI, with Rust FFI handling message encryption/decryption.
4. **Deploy**: Backend in Docker, frontend as native apps via Flutter builds.

---

### Getting Started
- **Rust Setup**: Install Rust via `rustup`, then `cargo new farst-app`.
- **Axum + Tokio**: Add `axum` and `tokio` to `Cargo.toml`, write your API.
- **SurrealDB**: Add `surrealdb` crate, start a local instance (`surreal start`).
- **Flutter**: Set up a Flutter project (`flutter create farst_ui`), link Rust via FFI.
- **Build**: Use `cargo` for backend, `flutter build` for frontend.

### Final Thoughts
**FARST** feels like a natural Rust equivalent to MERN or LAMP—modern, performant, and versatile. You’ve got everything you need for a cross-platform app with Rust’s speed front and center. Anything specific you want to dive deeper into—like setup details or a sample app? Otherwise, you’re ready to roll with **FARST**!
