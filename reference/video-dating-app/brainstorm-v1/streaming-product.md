yes thats probably better.

here are some ideas on services we can offer:

1) friends/families private 'house' - so a user can open a virtual 'house', and people in their 'circle' (ie people they added on their phone) gets notified and can join this virtual call and drop into the house virtually and drop out anytime they want. this gives them the ability to stay in touch with people they know and met in real life. but they can only invite people they already know or related to. 'close circle'. i think with our tech this should be easy to do and has a chance of going viral as people invite people they know into the network. presumably we shouldnt allow them to add a lot of people in their 'close circle'. probably should have a cap like linkedin or facebook has caps. they can clse their 'house' anytime they want.

2) they can also do general 'stream', eg if they want to run a webinar or educational or entertainment content, this platform lets them stream to a lot of people. we can offer paid tier upgrades that lets them scale to a lot (you can tell me what would be the cap and how we should price it). so this would appeal to marketers and people who wants to run webinars, the webinars market pricing is quite high nowadaysc, this can offer a cheaper/better alternative.

3) private 1-on-1 video calls. theres not too many options nowadays to do good quality video calls, our technology works across the planet to do 1-on-1 video calls for free (and can invite more people into the calls also if they need), so it becomes like a whatsapp video call thing.

we have to think on what areas we can monetize on here. whether to make everything free, or have a premium tier etc.

but essentially its almost like a social streaming platform but a 'business' version that can be used by content producers.
