## 1. Container Orchestration: Docker Swarm

### Decision
Use Docker Swarm for container orchestration instead of Kubernetes.

### Date
2025-03-25

### Context
We needed a container orchestration platform that provides high availability while remaining manageable for a small team.

### Rationale
- **Simplicity**: Docker Swarm has a significantly lower learning curve than Kubernetes
- **Native Docker integration**: Uses standard Docker API and Docker Compose files
- **Sufficient features**: Provides the core HA features needed (service replication, load balancing, rolling updates)
- **Lower resource requirements**: Runs efficiently on smaller nodes
- **Easier troubleshooting**: Simpler architecture means easier debugging

### Alternatives Considered
- **Kubernetes**: More feature-rich but significantly more complex to set up and maintain
- **Nomad**: Simpler than Kubernetes but less mature ecosystem than Docker Swarm
- **Single-node Docker**: Too limited for HA requirements

### Consequences
- Positive: Faster implementation time, easier maintenance
- Negative: Limited advanced features compared to Kubernetes (custom schedulers, advanced autoscaling)
- Negative: Smaller ecosystem of management tools

## 2. Configuration Management: Ansible

### Decision
Use Ansible for server configuration and application deployment.

### Date
2025-03-25

### Context
We needed a tool to automate server setup and application deployment across multiple environments.

### Rationale
- **Agentless**: No need to install agents on managed servers
- **YAML-based**: Easy to read and write configuration
- **Idempotent**: Can safely run multiple times
- **Rich templating**: Jinja2 templates allow for flexible configuration
- **Broad support**: Works with virtually any Linux distribution
- **Modular**: Roles and playbooks can be reused across projects

### Alternatives Considered
- **Chef/Puppet**: Require agents and have steeper learning curves
- **Salt**: More complex architecture
- **Custom scripts**: Lack idempotency and standardization
- **Terraform**: Better for infrastructure provisioning than configuration management

### Consequences
- Positive: Consistent, repeatable server configuration
- Positive: Ability to template application configurations
- Positive: Easy to understand for new team members
- Negative: Execution can be slower than compiled alternatives

## 3. Infrastructure as Code: Terraform

### Decision
Use Terraform for provisioning all cloud resources.

### Date
2025-03-25

### Context
We needed a tool to provision and manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers.

### Rationale
- **Multi-cloud support**: Works with all our chosen providers (Hetzner, GCP, Cloudflare)
- **Declarative syntax**: Define desired state rather than steps
- **State management**: Tracks current state of infrastructure
- **Provider ecosystem**: Rich set of providers for various services
- **Plan/Apply workflow**: Preview changes before applying them

### Alternatives Considered
- **Cloud-specific tools**: Would require multiple tools for different providers
- **Pulumi**: Code-first approach is more complex for our needs
- **CloudFormation**: AWS-specific and not applicable to our multi-cloud approach
- **Ansible**: Better for configuration than infrastructure provisioning

### Consequences
- Positive: Single tool for all infrastructure
- Positive: Version-controlled infrastructure definitions
- Positive: Clear visibility into planned changes
- Negative: State management requires careful handling

### Rationale
- **Tight GitHub integration**: Native integration with our code repository
- **YAML-based configuration**: Consistent with our other tools
- **Rich ecosystem**: Many pre-built actions available
- **Secrets management**: Built-in secrets storage
- **Matrix builds**: Test across multiple configurations
- **PR integration**: Comment on PRs with validation results

### Alternatives Considered
- **Jenkins**: More complex to set up and maintain
- **CircleCI/Travis**: External services with additional costs
- **Serverless Functions**: Considered for deployment orchestration but less integrated with Git workflow
- **GitLab CI**: Would require moving to GitLab

### Consequences
- Positive: Seamless integration with GitHub
- Positive: No additional infrastructure to maintain
- Positive: Built-in secrets management
- Negative: Vendor lock-in to GitHub

## 5. Secrets Management: Git-crypt

### Decision
Use git-crypt for encrypting sensitive information in the repository.

### Date
2025-03-25

### Context
We needed a way to securely store secrets alongside our code while maintaining version control.

### Rationale
- **Transparent encryption**: Works within Git workflow
- **GPG-based**: Uses established encryption standards
- **Selective encryption**: Can encrypt only specific files
- **Team-based access**: Multiple team members can access with their own keys
- **Version control**: Secrets remain in version control

### Alternatives Considered
- **Vault**: More complex to set up and maintain
- **Environment variables**: Difficult to version control
- **External secret stores**: Adds complexity to deployment
- **Ansible Vault**: Limited to Ansible-specific files

### Consequences
- Positive: Secrets stay with related code
- Positive: Version control for secrets
- Positive: Works with existing Git workflow
- Negative: Requires careful key management
- Negative: All-or-nothing access model (no partial access)

- **Envoy**: Steeper learning curve
- **Cloudflare**: Already used as external CDN/proxy

### Consequences
- Positive: Automatic service discovery
- Positive: Simplified SSL management
- Positive: Easy configuration through labels
- Negative: Less mature than Nginx/HAProxy
- Negative: Some advanced features require Pro version

## 8. Backup Strategy: Serverless Approach

### Decision
Use a serverless approach for backup automation with temporary servers created from snapshots.

### Date
2025-03-25

### Context
We needed a cost-effective and reliable backup solution that minimizes infrastructure costs while ensuring data safety.

### Rationale
- **Cost efficiency**: Only pay for server resources during actual backup operations
- **Automation**: Fully automated process triggered by Cloud Scheduler
- **Flexibility**: Different backup types (daily, weekly, monthly) handled by the same infrastructure
- **Self-healing**: Server self-destructs after backup completion, eliminating orphaned resources
- **Monitoring integration**: Status updates stored in Firestore for monitoring

### Alternatives Considered
- **Permanent backup server**: Higher cost for an always-on server
- **Direct volume backup**: More complex to implement with distributed storage

## 11. Configuration Structure: Environment and Application-Specific

### Decision
Organize Ansible configuration with both environment-specific and application-specific variables.

### Date
2025-03-25

### Context
We needed a configuration structure that allows for both environment-level defaults and application-specific customization.

### Rationale
- **Environment directories**: Separate dev/staging/prod configurations
- **Application-specific files**: Isolate application variables
- **Inheritance**: Common variables at higher levels
- **Clear organization**: Easy to find specific settings
- **Reduced duplication**: Share common configurations

### Alternatives Considered

### Decision
Use a Pull Request-based workflow with validation and preview before deployment.

### Date
2025-03-25

### Context
We needed a deployment process that ensures changes are reviewed and validated before reaching production.

### Rationale
- **Code review**: Changes are reviewed by team members

### Rationale
- **Real-time updates**: Webhooks provide immediate notification of changes
- **Reduced polling**: No need for constant API polling, reducing load and costs
- **Edge computing**: Cloudflare Workers process requests at the edge for lower latency
- **Scalability**: Automatically scales with request volume
- **Cost efficiency**: Pay only for actual usage

### Alternatives Considered
- **Polling-based integration**: Higher latency and resource usage
