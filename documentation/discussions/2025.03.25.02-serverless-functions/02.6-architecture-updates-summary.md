# Architecture Updates Summary

Based on our discussion about the serverless functions requirements, we've made the following updates to the architecture documentation:

## 1. Added New Core Components

- Added **Serverless Functions** as a core component, including Google Cloud Functions, Cloudflare Workers, Google Cloud Scheduler, and Google Pub/Sub
- Added **External API Integrations** as a core component, including Aircall API, Guesty API, webhook-based synchronization, and vector representation
- Added **AI and LLM Integration** as a core component, including Qdrant Vector Database, Groq Cloud, RocketChat integration, and automated vectorization

## 2. Updated Backup Approach

- Added Google Cloud Scheduler for triggering backups
- Implemented a temporary server creation from a snapshot
- Added self-destruction mechanism after backup completion
- Added status tracking in Firestore

## 3. Enhanced GCP Integration

- Added Cloud Scheduler for reliable scheduling
- Added Pub/Sub for event-driven messaging
