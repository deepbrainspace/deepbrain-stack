# Decision to Revert to RocketChat

## Overview

After evaluating Chatwoot as a potential replacement for RocketChat, we have decided to revert to our original plan of using RocketChat with custom app development and Firestore. This document outlines the reasoning behind this decision and the implications for our architecture.

## Limitations of Chatwoot for Team Functionality

While Chatwoot offers excellent customer-facing communication capabilities, we encountered significant limitations when attempting to use it for internal team communications:

1. **Limited Channel Structure**: Chatwoot's inbox-based model doesn't provide the persistent, topic-based channels that our team requires for effective collaboration.

2. **Team Communication Constraints**: The internal notes and team-only conversations in Chatwoot are primarily designed to support customer conversations, not standalone team discussions.

3. **Workflow Limitations**: Our team workflows require more flexible communication patterns than Chatwoot's primarily customer-service oriented design can accommodate.

4. **Custom App Development Complexity**: Implementing the necessary team functionality through Chatwoot's custom app framework would require significant development effort, potentially exceeding the effort of enhancing RocketChat.

## Benefits of Returning to RocketChat

1. **Native Team Collaboration**: RocketChat's channel-based structure is purpose-built for team collaboration with features like threads, mentions, and file sharing.

2. **Custom App Flexibility**: RocketChat's app framework provides more flexibility for implementing our specific requirements.

3. **Existing Integration Plans**: We already have well-developed plans for integrating RocketChat with our AI system and external services.

4. **Familiar Interface**: The team is already familiar with channel-based communication platforms similar to RocketChat.

## Architectural Implications

Reverting to RocketChat means we will:

1. **Continue with MongoDB**: Use MongoDB as the database for RocketChat instead of switching to PostgreSQL.

2. **Maintain Firestore Integration**: Continue with our original plan to use Firestore for operational data.

3. **Implement Custom RocketChat App**: Develop a custom RocketChat app to enhance its capabilities for our specific needs.

4. **Adapt AI Integration**: Focus our AI integration efforts on the RocketChat platform rather than Chatwoot.

## Implementation Approach

1. **Custom RocketChat App Development**:
   - Create a custom app that enhances RocketChat's capabilities for our specific workflows
   - Implement integrations with external systems (Guesty, Aircall)
   - Develop AI assistant functionality within the RocketChat interface

2. **Firestore Data Structure**:
   - Maintain our original Firestore data model for operational data
   - Implement efficient synchronization between RocketChat and Firestore

3. **AI Integration**:
   - Continue with the planned LLM Query Worker for processing natural language queries
   - Maintain the vector database approach for context retrieval
   - Implement response formatting specific to RocketChat's interface

## Conclusion

After thorough evaluation, we've determined that RocketChat with custom app development better meets our requirements for team communication while still providing adequate capabilities for our AI integration needs. This decision allows us to proceed with our original architectural approach while focusing development efforts on enhancing RocketChat's capabilities rather than adapting to Chatwoot's limitations.

The next steps will involve finalizing the RocketChat custom app requirements and beginning development according to our original implementation plan.
