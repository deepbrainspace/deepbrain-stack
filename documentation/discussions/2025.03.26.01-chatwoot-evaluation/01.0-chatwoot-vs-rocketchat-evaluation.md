# Chatwoot vs. RocketChat Evaluation

## Overview

This document captures the discussion about potentially switching from RocketChat to Chatwoot for the BnB customer handling system. The evaluation focuses on how each platform would handle both internal and external communications, integration with existing systems (Guesty, Aircall), and the role of AI in enhancing the guest experience.

## Current Architecture

The current architecture uses RocketChat as the team communication platform, integrated with:
- MongoDB as its database
- Keycloak for identity management
- AI capabilities through Groq Cloud for LLM inference
- Vector search via Qdrant for context-aware responses

RocketChat is primarily positioned as an internal team communication platform, with AI integration to help staff access business information through natural language queries.

## Chatwoot vs. RocketChat Comparison

### Chatwoot Advantages:

1. **Unified Communication Platform**: Chatwoot is specifically designed to handle both internal team communication and external customer interactions in one platform.

2. **Omnichannel Support**: Chatwoot natively supports multiple communication channels (website chat, email, WhatsApp, SMS, social media) which would be valuable for a BnB business needing to communicate with guests across different platforms.

3. **Customer-Centric Features**: Built-in features like shared inbox, canned responses, customer profiles, and conversation assignment are specifically designed for customer service scenarios.

4. **Guest-Centric Organization**: Chatwoot organizes conversations around contacts (guests), which aligns perfectly with BnB operations:
   - Each guest would have a unified profile with all their conversations across channels
   - Custom attributes from Guesty (booking dates, room preferences, special requests) can be attached directly to the guest profile
   - Historical interactions are preserved for context when the guest returns

5. **Automated Workflows**: Support for automated routing and tagging:
   - Staff can tag conversations (e.g., "maintenance")
   - Automation rules can route tagged conversations to the appropriate team inbox
   - Status tracking through labels (pending, in progress, completed)

6. **Integration Capabilities**: Chatwoot has robust API and webhook capabilities that would allow for similar AI integrations as currently implemented with RocketChat.

### RocketChat Advantages:

1. **Team Collaboration Focus**: RocketChat excels at internal team communication with features like channels, threads, and file sharing.

2. **Channel Structure**: RocketChat has a more robust concept of persistent "channels" for team discussions, which Chatwoot lacks.

3. **Current Integration**: The system is already designed with RocketChat in mind, including the AI integration for natural language queries.

4. **Customizability**: RocketChat is highly customizable and has a strong open-source community.

## Internal Communications with Chatwoot

Chatwoot supports internal team communications, but in a different way than RocketChat:

### Team Inbox and Assignments
- **Shared Inboxes**: Chatwoot organizes communications into "inboxes" that team members can access based on their roles. Dedicated inboxes could be created for maintenance, cleaning, front desk, etc.
- **Assignment System**: Conversations can be assigned to specific team members, making it clear who's responsible for what task.
- **Team Mentions**: Team members can mention each other within conversations using @mentions.

### Internal Notes
- **Private Notes**: Team members can add private notes to any conversation that are only visible to other team members, not to customers.
- **Context Preservation**: These notes stay attached to the relevant conversation, keeping all context in one place.

### Team Collaboration Features
- **Conversation Labels**: Categorize conversations with labels like "urgent maintenance," "scheduled cleaning," etc.
- **Custom Attributes**: Track additional information about conversations with custom fields.
- **Canned Responses**: Create standardized responses for common situations that all team members can use.

### Limitations for Internal Communications
1. **Channel Structure**: Chatwoot doesn't have the same concept of persistent "channels" like RocketChat. It's more conversation-focused rather than channel-focused.

2. **Team Chat Focus**: While internal notes and team-only conversations are possible, Chatwoot's primary design is for customer conversations with internal coordination around those, not primarily for team-to-team chat.
