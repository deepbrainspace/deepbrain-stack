# Database Consolidation and Future Milestones

## Database Consolidation with Chatwoot

### Current Database Architecture
The current architecture uses:
- MongoDB for RocketChat
- Firestore for storing application data and backup status
- Qdrant for vector storage

### Potential Consolidation with Chatwoot
Chatwoot uses PostgreSQL as its database, which offers an opportunity to consolidate data storage:

#### Benefits of Consolidation:
1. **Reduced Data Duplication**: Store guest information in a single location rather than duplicating across systems
2. **Simplified Architecture**: Fewer components to maintain and monitor
3. **Relational Database Advantages**: PostgreSQL offers robust relational capabilities, transactions, and data integrity
4. **Extensibility**: PostgreSQL schemas can be extended to store additional business data
5. **Direct Vector Indexing**: The database can be directly indexed for AI interactions

#### Implementation Approach:
1. **Schema Extension**: Extend Chatwoot's PostgreSQL schema to include additional fields for:
   - Property details
   - Local information
   - Business policies
   - Terms and conditions
   - Operational procedures

2. **Vector Indexing Process**:
   - Set up a regular process to extract data from PostgreSQL
   - Transform and vectorize the data
   - Store vectors in Qdrant
   - This process can run on a schedule or be triggered by database changes

3. **Migration Path**:
   - Migrate existing data from Firestore to PostgreSQL
   - Map data structures to the extended schema
   - Validate data integrity after migration

#### Considerations:
1. **Database Performance**: Ensure that extending Chatwoot's database doesn't impact its performance
2. **Backup Strategy**: Adjust backup procedures to account for the consolidated database
3. **Schema Updates**: Plan for handling schema updates when upgrading Chatwoot
4. **Data Access Patterns**: Optimize for the specific access patterns of the BnB operation

## Guesty Integration Strategy

### Current Role of Guesty
Guesty currently serves as a middleware for:
- Collecting booking information from platforms (Booking.com, Airbnb, VRBO)
- Managing property listings across platforms
- Handling pricing and availability
- Processing payments
- Managing guest communications

### Integration Options

#### Option 1: Continue Using Guesty with Chatwoot Integration
- **Approach**: Maintain Guesty as the primary property management system and integrate it with Chatwoot
- **Data Flow**: Guesty â†’ Chatwoot for guest communications
- **Benefits**:
  - Faster MVP deployment
  - Leverages existing Guesty capabilities
  - Maintains established connections with booking platforms
- **Considerations**:
  - Requires building and maintaining integration between systems
  - Some data duplication will still exist

#### Option 2: Replace Guesty with Direct Platform Integrations
- **Approach**: Build direct integrations between Chatwoot and booking platforms
- **Benefits**:
  - Eliminates middleware costs
  - Reduces data synchronization complexity
  - More direct control over the entire process
- **Considerations**:
  - Significantly more development work
  - Would need to rebuild many features Guesty provides
  - Would delay MVP timeline considerably

### Recommendation for MVP
For the MVP phase, Option 1 (continuing to use Guesty with Chatwoot integration) is recommended:
1. Focus on getting Chatwoot operational as the communication hub
2. Build a solid integration between Guesty and Chatwoot
3. Evaluate the need to replace Guesty after the MVP is successful

This approach allows for a faster MVP deployment while still improving the overall system through Chatwoot's communication capabilities.

## Team Communication Protocols

### Unified Communication Strategy

With Chatwoot as the central platform, a clear protocol for team communications would be:

#### Guest-Related Communications
- **Primary Platform**: Chatwoot
- **Use Cases**:
  - All guest interactions (pre-booking, during stay, post-stay)
  - Task assignments related to specific guests
  - Internal notes about guest preferences or issues
  - Maintenance requests related to occupied units

#### Operational Communications
- **Primary Platform**: Chatwoot (with structured workflows)
- **Use Cases**:
  - Maintenance tasks for unoccupied units
  - Cleaning schedules and verification
  - Inventory management
  - Staff scheduling and coordination

#### Team Announcements and General Discussion
- **Options**:
  1. **Chatwoot Team Inbox**: Create a dedicated "Team" inbox in Chatwoot
  2. **Lightweight Chat Tool**: Use a simple tool like Slack or Discord for general team chat
  3. **Hybrid Approach**: Use Chatwoot for operational communications and a separate tool for general team discussions

### Access Management
- Provide Chatwoot login to all team members
- Configure role-based access controls:
  - Front Desk: Access to all guest communications
  - Maintenance: Access to maintenance-tagged conversations only
  - Housekeeping: Access to cleaning-related conversations only
  - Management: Access to all conversations and reporting

### Mobile Access
- Utilize Chatwoot's mobile apps for all team members
- Ensure notifications are properly configured for timely responses

## Knowledge Management Strategy

### Knowledge Base Requirements
The BnB operation has detailed training and operational knowledge that needs to be:
- Easily accessible to team members
- Searchable by the AI system
- Regularly updated
- Structured for easy navigation

### Knowledge Management Options

#### Option 1: Extend Chatwoot with Knowledge Base
- **Approach**: Store knowledge base content directly in the extended PostgreSQL schema
- **Benefits**:
  - Keeps all information in one system
  - Simplifies vector indexing
- **Considerations**:
  - Chatwoot doesn't have built-in knowledge base features
  - Would require custom development

#### Option 2: Dedicated Knowledge Base System
- **Approach**: Use a dedicated knowledge base system (e.g., DocuWiki, GitBook, or custom solution)
- **Benefits**:
  - Purpose-built for knowledge management
  - Better content organization and versioning
  - More robust search capabilities
- **Considerations**:
  - Adds another system to maintain
  - Requires integration with the AI system

#### Option 3: Structured Documents in Storage
- **Approach**: Store knowledge base as structured documents (Markdown, JSON) in a file system
- **Benefits**:
  - Simple to implement
  - Easy version control with Git
  - Straightforward to vector index
- **Considerations**:
  - Limited user interface for non-technical users
  - No built-in search or navigation

### Recommendation for Knowledge Management
For the BnB operation, Option 2 (Dedicated Knowledge Base System) is recommended:
1. Implement a lightweight, API-accessible knowledge base system
2. Structure content in a hierarchical manner
3. Set up regular vector indexing of the knowledge base content
