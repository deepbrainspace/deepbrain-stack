### Implementation Approach

#### Creating Internal Communication Inboxes

For inboxes that don't correspond to external channels (like the Operational, Financial, Team Coordination inboxes), you would:

1. **Create API-type Inboxes**:
   - Set up API-type inboxes in Chatwoot
   - Generate API credentials for each

2. **Create Internal Contacts**:
   - Set up contacts for team members or departments
   - Organize them with appropriate attributes and tags

3. **Custom Integration**:
   - Develop a simple interface (web or mobile) for team members to interact with these inboxes
   - Use Chatwoot's API to send/receive messages
   - Alternatively, extend Chatwoot's UI with custom elements

4. **Mobile Access**:
   - Ensure the Chatwoot mobile app can access these internal inboxes
   - Configure notifications appropriately

#### Automation and Routing

To make this multi-inbox approach effective:

1. **Inbox Assignment Rules**:
   - Set up rules to automatically assign conversations to appropriate team members
   - Use tags, keywords, and contact attributes for routing

2. **Cross-Inbox Coordination**:
   - Create processes for transferring conversations between inboxes when needed
   - Example: Guest request that requires maintenance can be shared or transferred

3. **Status and Label Standardization**:
   - Create consistent labels across inboxes (urgent, pending, resolved, etc.)
   - Establish clear status definitions for different types of conversations

4. **Notification Management**:
   - Configure notification settings to ensure team members receive alerts for relevant conversations
   - Avoid notification fatigue with proper prioritization

### Advantages Over Separate Platforms

Using Chatwoot's multi-inbox approach instead of separate platforms like RocketChat offers several advantages:

1. **Unified Interface**: Team members learn and use a single system
