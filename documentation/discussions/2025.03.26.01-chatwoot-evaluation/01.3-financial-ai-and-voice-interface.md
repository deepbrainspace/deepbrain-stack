The financial AI would integrate with Chatwoot in several ways:

1. **Dedicated Financial Inbox**
   - Create a specific "Finance" inbox in Chatwoot
   - Finance team members can ask questions directly
   - AI responds with financial insights and data
   - Conversation history preserved for context

2. **Proactive Notifications**
   - AI sends alerts about important financial events
   - Examples: "Cash balance below threshold", "Unusual expense detected"
   - Alerts appear as new conversations in the Finance inbox
   - Team members can respond and ask follow-up questions

3. **Contextual Financial Data in Guest Conversations**
   - When viewing a guest conversation, show relevant financial data
   - Example: "This guest has spent $X across Y stays, with Z pending"
   - Helps inform decisions about upgrades, discounts, or special treatment

4. **Financial Commands in Any Conversation**
   - Allow specific financial queries from any conversation
   - Example: "@finance what's our occupancy revenue for next month?"
   - AI responds with the requested information
   - Keeps financial data accessible to authorized team members

#### Natural Language Query Capabilities
- **Financial Questions**: "What was our revenue last week compared to the same week last year?"
- **Forecasting Queries**: "What's our projected cash position at the end of the month?"
- **Expense Inquiries**: "Show me our top 5 expense categories this quarter"
- **Booking Channel Analysis**: "Which booking platform had the highest fees last month?"

AI Voice: "Lakeside Cabin has a checkout this morning at 10 AM. The Johnson family is departing after a 3-night stay. A cleaning team is scheduled for 11 AM. The next guests, the Williams family, will arrive at 4 PM for a 5-night stay. Would you like more details about either reservation?"
```

#### Maintenance Request
```
Team Member: "Report a maintenance issue at Mountain View property."

AI Voice: "What's the maintenance issue at Mountain View property?"

Team Member: "The kitchen faucet is leaking."

AI Voice: "I've created a maintenance task for a leaking kitchen faucet at Mountain View property. It's assigned to the maintenance team with normal priority. Should I change the priority or add more details?"
```

#### Guest Communication
```
Team Member: "Send a message to the guests arriving today."

AI Voice: "You have two check-ins today: The Williams family at Lakeside Cabin and the Garcia couple at Forest Retreat. Which guests would you like to message?"

Team Member: "The Williams family."

AI Voice: "What message would you like to send to the Williams family?"

Team Member: "We're looking forward to your arrival today. Please let us know your estimated check-in time."
