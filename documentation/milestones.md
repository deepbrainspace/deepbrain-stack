## Timeline Overview

```
Days 1-5:    Milestone 1 - Infrastructure as Code Setup
Days 6-9:    Milestone 2 - Ansible Configuration
Days 10-14:  Milestone 3 - Base Ecosystem Setup
Days 15-19:  Milestone 4 - Chatwoot Deployment
Days 20-25:  Milestone 5 - AI Integration
Days 26-30:  Milestone 6 - Voice Capabilities
Days 31-34:  Milestone 7 - Testing and Optimization
Days 35-37:  Milestone 8 - Documentation and Handoff
```

Total estimated timeline: 37 days (approximately 7-8 weeks)

With your 30 years of development/DevOps experience and AI assistance, this timeline could potentially be accelerated. The most time-intensive aspects will likely be the AI integration and voice processing setup, as these involve newer technologies and more complex integration points.
