I can help you create a Mermaid diagram to visualize your marketing project plan. Here's a flowchart that represents the steps you described:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Launch AI-Generated Viral Videos] --> B{Are Videos Viral?}
    B -->|No| A
    B -->|Yes| C[Monetize Videos]
    C --> D[Crypto Token Launch]
    C --> E[Affiliate Products]
    D --> F[Build Track Record]
    E --> F
    F --> G[Develop Influencer Product]
    G --> H[Scale to $12B+]
```

This diagram shows:
1. The initial launch of AI-generated viral videos in a loop until they go viral
2. Once viral, moving to monetization through two parallel paths (crypto token and affiliate products)
3. Building a track record from the monetization success
4. Developing a product for influencers
5. Scaling to your $12B+ goal
